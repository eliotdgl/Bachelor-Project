In this project, we develop a model aiming at predicting air pollution levels based on traffic data within a specific area. The model considers both traffic emissions and meteorological conditions, with a particular focus on wind. Our study area is a section of the M25, a major highway surrounding London, England. To model air diffusion, we employ advection-diffusion PDEs. Advection is solved numerically using an explicit upwind scheme, while diffusion using implicit Crank-Nicolson method. Traffic emissions are included as a source term in the PDEs, with wind influencing the advection component. Finally, we analyse the obtained results, com- pare them against pollution concentration guidelines, and discuss the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
